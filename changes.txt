Features in momo branch:
- binary blacklist is applied during import
- duplicate releases are skipped during import (rather than during update_releases)
- added a "Disabled" status for categories which makes any releases that belong there just get deleted
- added an "API Only" option to the site registration option which disables the GUI and allows public API access (requires a small DB hack)
- improved categories.php so movies from a.b.hdtv* don't go into the TV > HD category
- made 1080i releases go into TV > Other instead of TV > HD
- allow release regex's group names to be regexes themselves so you can apply to alt.binaries.(multimedia|teevee) or alt.binaries.*\.tv.* for example
- new default role "Moderator" which allows users to edit/delete releases but gives them no other special admin functions
- tweaked isForeignTV() to filter stuff like "German" but not "Germany"
- added resetdb.php which resets all your parts/binaries/releases tables to default (empty)
- supports regexes with no group for the part numbers, it can find the part numbers later during release processing if they're omitted in the regex
